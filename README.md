# SeaSweeper

SeaSweeper is our effort to safeguard our planet's most precious resource: water. Our mission is to revolutionize marine conservation through technology, focusing on oil spill remediation, trash collection, and ecosystem restoration as well as disclosing water quality information to the public, allowing them to monitor and report bodies of water that they believe need to be “swept”.

Our hack consists of two main components: a hardware prototype designed to clean and monitor water bodies, and a software component that serves as the hub for data sharing and community engagement.

## Features

- **Hardware Prototype (Sweeper Bot)**
  - Collects and separates oil from water.
  - Gathers debris such as plastic and other waste.
  - Detects elevated temperatures and deposits iron minerals to stimulate phytoplankton growth.
  - Monitors carbon dioxide levels.

- **Software Component (Data Hub and Community Platform)**
  - Displays locations of aquatic bots (sweepers) on a map.
  - Allows users to browse locations, use their own location, or input specific coordinates.
  - Enables users to report bodies of water needing attention.

## How It Works

1. **Hardware Prototype**
   - Operates underwater to collect data and clean water bodies.
   - Uses advanced modules for various environmental tasks.

2. **Software Component**
   - Website with a map showing sweeper bot locations.
   - Users can click on sweeper dots to view bot details and data.
   - Provides reporting functionality for users to report water bodies needing cleaning.

## Getting Started

To get started with SeaSweeper, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Dilashmar/seasweeper.git`
2. Install necessary dependencies.
3. Set up the hardware prototype and connect it to the software platform.
4. Run the application and start monitoring and cleaning water bodies.
